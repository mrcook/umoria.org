## About Umoria

_The Dungeons of Moria_ is a single player dungeon simulation written by Robert
Alan Koeneke, with v1.0 released in 1983. The game was originally written in
VMS Pascal before being ported to the C language and released as _Umoria_ in
1988. Moria has had many variants over the years, with _Angband_ being the most
well known, and was also an inspiration for one the most commercially
successful action roguelike games, _Diablo_!
